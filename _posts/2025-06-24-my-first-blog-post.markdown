# A000 Start a blog

**(23/06/2025)**

Started after dinner. Before I could even start with writing this blog, I had to install a bunch of stuff. I've managed to install most of it through CLI (*CLI is growing on me heavily*).
Setup everything from git to jekyll, SSH'd my github and I was ready to go. Generated the site using Jekyll, removed most of the jekyll example pages. After that I took a little break to deal with something personal. Getting back from that I spent most of the time looking for themes. Couldn't find a theme that I liked so I figured I'd go with the standard minima theme. Clock hit 2am so figured it was time to hit the hay.

Spent the start of my afternoon looking for themes, *again...* Same result, so I figured I'd try to make some css changes. Turns out you can't just simply change the "main.css" file for the page. What a bummer, I've looked up how to add custom css, looked at my page again and figured, it's about what's on the blog, not how it looks like. I'm a fan of simple and clear design so I gave up on the css, *who likes doing frontend anyway, right?* Spent a small amount of time changing some markdown posts and writing this post. I'm leaving the design of the page boring as it is as I really don't wanna bother with the css, I just couldn't care less *I'm sorry*.

***tl;dr*** Installing prerequisites went smooth, generating the site went smooth. Looking for a fitting theme was a nightmare, changing main.css didn't work, adding custom css seemed like a hassle for what you get out of it (imo). Changed page content and tested if the blog posts work properly. Everything seems to be fine.
