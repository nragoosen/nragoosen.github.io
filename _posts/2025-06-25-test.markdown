# A002 Write a javascript app

**(24/06/2025)**

The assignment was bit unspecific on whether what it expected. Nonetheless I started working towards what I thought was needed along with a friend of mine. Made a rough prototype, after a bit we got the basics working, from that point on everything went smooth. Grabbed some basic css from internet, tweaked it a bit to my own liking, looked at different approaches with js and picked one that seemed the most clean. The HTML remained pretty standard, not much going on in there.

My JS knowledge is pretty minimum so the help of my friend and internet helped, pretty fun assignment but a bit underwhelming if I'm honest. Nonetheless it's one of the first assignments so a normal buildup seems fair.

***tl;dr*** Went smoother than expected, it was fun to do although it felt a bit underwhelming. Maybe enlarge the assignment a bit more, this wouldn't necessarily make it harder but it'd make it more interesting.
