# A003 Network week one (1)

**(30/06/2025)**

For the first subject of network week I've decided to pick up on the topic of firewalls. The reason why is, I know what a firewall is and what it does but I'd like to get some more in-depth knowledge of firewalls.

A firewall is the first line of defense against any bad harm coming towards your network, i.e. cyber threats, malicious attacks and unauthorized access attempts from the outside. The firewall helps filtering this, imagine it as some sort of border control. The packages come in/go out, the firewall funnels it and checks the packages for bad intentions. 

All firewalls have three basic functions
- Blocking unauthorized access
- Allowing legitimate traffic
- Preventing malicious software from spreading

Theres also a bunch of different firewalls, where some kinds of firewalls work on different OSI layers, the most common layers being layer 3 (network) and 4 (transport).
I was gonna list them here but the more I'm reading into it, the deeper the rabbithole goes. So I'm gonna link the 2 sources I've used most for this. 

This way, may you be interested you can check those out and so I can read into it at any later moment.

***tl;dr*** A firewall checks incoming and outgoing packages, being the first line of defense when it comes to cyber attacks or malicious packages.
There are a bunch of different firewalls, most of them operating on layer 3 and 4 of the ISO layer.
This topic is such a rabbithole so for more information check out the 2 links that I put under sources.
