# A003 Network week one (2)

**(01/07/2025)**

For this day I've decided to check out Domain Name System some more, also known as **DNS**.
*"The DNS is a hierarchical and distributed name service that provides a naming system for computers, services, and other resources on the internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks.*
What this pretty much means, (it's a common example), is that DNS serves as a phone book. Where in a phone book each phone number has a name of a person or company attached to it. 
DNS does the  same but with IP addresses. This way we're able to type in the name of the website instead of the actual IP.

When we i.e. type in google.com in our web-browser, we get redirected to google.com *duh*.  We have to thank DNS for this, when we type in google.com (<- this is the hostname) DNS translates this hostname to the linked IP address it has, which makes it possible for the computer to know where to go. 

This is what DNS does in a short summary, I've read most of the wiki and there is a lot more to it than what I've wrote down, but I'm also no trying to make this the size of an essay. So if you're interested, help yourself :^).
