# A004 Write a network services status checker (3)

**(02/07/2025)**

Before starting this assignment I wasn't really sure if I was gonna be able to do it, but I figured I'd atleast have to give it a shot. Started off with downloading the given modules during class *(Flask, requests)* so I could import these into my python script. Made the directory and the file for the script and called it a day. Told myself I'd work on it the day after, unfortenately that day went different than expected *like always*. So I was only able to start working on it from 16:00. After starting off I got stuck pretty quick *(don't laugh)* but I forgot a decorator somewhere which I kept overlooking for half an hour straight *lmao*. 

After fixing that I had the logic down pretty fast. After getting some errors, checking it out and fixing the problems. The logic was working. Now I just needed to get it to display in an html file. A couple google searches later I found some examples I could work with and starting creating my own html template. Got that working too. 

After I got the logic working and rendered into a template, I re-read my code and figured I could make some small improvements so I went ahead and did that. Even after that the code was still working *hoo-ray*. Spent some time tweaking the html, then decided I'd add some css for the sake of it, cause it looked ugly as it was. Now I'm no css expert so this took a chunk of time but I'd say it was worth it compared to how it looked *"raw"*. 

Overall, I was happy with what I made, but the time it took me made me doubt myself if I even did it right, turns out I did so that's a big win. Did better than expected so I'm happy with that. This was a fun assignment to mess around with.

***tl;dr*** Doubted myself at first, did well and in decent time, turns out I did good *???*. Overall happy with how I did and what I did. Fun assignment to do, would recommend.
