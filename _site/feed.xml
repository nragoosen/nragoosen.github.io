<p><strong>(20/06/2025)</strong></p>

<p>Smooth start, slowed down a bit partitioning the disks, formatting and mounting the partitions went alright. 
Getting some errors trying to install nano with pacman. 
Figured out the issue, apparently my filesystem was read-only? Decided to retry the installation progress, practice makes perfect right?
After getting distracted by my dog terrorizing the upper floors, went downstairs to give it a retry. Managed to install nano.</p>

<p>Might’ve done another fuck up, having a distracting dog during this process probably isn’t the best combination. (edit: it didn’t work because I didn’t actually install a boat-loader lol, stupid in hindsight) Giving it one last shot for the night, if I fuck up again I guess we’ll shoot some more tomorrow.</p>

<p>After some more messing around we took another step in the right direction, I can now actually boot the existing OS. It is saying incorrect login so I probably messed that shit up now. I’m going to completely re-install it again (speedrun time?). Try to do it flawlessly this time without messing anything up. My dog is asleep so that might help(?).</p>

<p>Speedrun it was, I can now login as root in my arch Linux terminal. Spend a good couple of hours trying to figure it out clicking an endless amount of hyperlinks and reading more than I wanted on my Friday night, but not without reward.</p>

<p><strong>(22/06/2025)</strong> After not having any time to work on this yesterday due to me having some friends over and alcohol making me change my mind about going out. So here we are, after successfully surviving my hangover, decided to spend some time on it this steaming hot evening. Adding the user went without any trouble so far, working on getting a desktop environment now.</p>

<p>After running into some more issues, that were kinda a skill issue from my side <em>lol</em>, I’ve managed to get all the requirements for this extra assignment working. Only thing is that I can’t directly connect to wi-fi due to the fact that I hooked my VM up to the NAT network I made in VirtualBox. Besides, I think I’d get that working pretty flawlessly too.</p>

<p><strong><em>tl;dr</em></strong> Overall, this was an “experience”, I loved working in the terminal and funnily enough I <strong>didn’t</strong> even want to shoot myself when something went wrong. I didn’t do this in one sitting, so I’m not sure if I stuck to the 1 day time limit, timewise probably yes, but it wasn’t done in one day. I know I don’t have to commit to the time limit but it’s an extra challenge to strive for it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Nick Goosen</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A001 Install arch, by the way]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My first blog post</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/06/24/my-first-blog-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My first blog post" /><published>2025-06-24T01:30:41+02:00</published><updated>2025-06-24T01:30:41+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/06/24/my-first-blog-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/06/24/my-first-blog-post.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="a000-start-a-blog">A000 Start a blog</h1>

<p><strong>(23/06/2025)</strong></p>

<p>Started after dinner. Before I could even start with writing this blog, I had to install a bunch of stuff. I’ve managed to install most of it through CLI (<em>CLI is growing on me heavily</em>).
Setup everything from git to jekyll, SSH’d my github and I was ready to go. Generated the site using Jekyll, removed most of the jekyll example pages. After that I took a little break to deal with something personal. Getting back from that I spent most of the time looking for themes. Couldn’t find a theme that I liked so I figured I’d go with the standard minima theme. Clock hit 2am so figured it was time to hit the hay.</p>

<p><strong>(24/06/2025)</strong></p>

<p>Spent the start of my afternoon looking for themes, <em>again…</em> Same result, so I figured I’d try to make some css changes. Turns out you can’t just simply change the “main.css” file for the page. What a bummer, I’ve looked up how to add custom css, looked at my page again and figured, it’s about what’s on the blog, not how it looks like. I’m a fan of simple and clear design so I gave up on the css, <em>who likes doing frontend anyway, right?</em> Spent a small amount of time changing some markdown posts and writing this post. I’m leaving the design of the page boring as it is as I really don’t wanna bother with the css, I just couldn’t care less <em>I’m sorry</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>tl;dr</em></strong> Installing prerequisites went smooth, generating the site went smooth. Looking for a fitting theme was a nightmare, changing main.css didn’t work, adding custom css seemed like a hassle for what you get out of it (imo). Changed page content and tested if the blog posts work properly. Everything seems to be fine.</p>]]></content><author><name>Nick Goosen</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A000 Start a blog]]></summary></entry></feed>
